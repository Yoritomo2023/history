                         Hello readers.<br>
                         I am a student currently studying in Japan. <br><br>
                        
                         There are two reasons behind why I created this website. First of all, I want people to understand basic Japanese history. Because Japan is an archipelago, our culture and history is very unique. It would be an honor for you to come to like Japan even more by reading the content on this website. 
                         The second reason for why I created this website is because there aren’t many websites out there which explain Japanese history. I hope you’ll find the content on this website useful. <br><br>
                        
                         Currently, there are many problems happening around the world because of diversity in culture and religion. We have to learn about each other’s history if we want to solve these problems. Hence, when creating this website, I tried not to include any bias. 
                        
                         <br><br> With this said, I am a student who is still studying history so there might be minor mistakes in the information I provide. If there are any flaws in the information on this website, please inform me through the link below.
                          <br><br>I hope this website will be useful for expanding your knowledge about history.
